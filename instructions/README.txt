**Oliver Mapps Ultramarin Coding Challenge**

Each question is answered in the format of a Python Jupyter Notebook. In order to open and run these files, I recommend using Anaconda since it automatically installs the libraries and frameworks used in the answers. I chose this format since it allows the reader understand each step, since the author can break down code and explain each part. 

In the /data/ directory, there can be found the original data.csv file, among the other data files that I generate through the process. These are suffixed by the question they relate to.

In the /figures/ directory are stored the plots generated for Question B.2.

Then, each question and their accompanying files are stored in their respective directiories.

Below are some brief notes on each question

Question A.1: In this folder there is just a mathematical derivation of the necessary values. These calculations are then implemented at the start of my solution to A.2.

Question A.2: This folder contains the notebook documenting the development of various candidate models, in the end I choose an LSTM based model.

Question B.1: The notebook here simply augments the dataframe to incorporate the revelant time series.

Question B.2: This folder contains necessary derivations and produces the relevant plots, which are stored in the /figures/ folder as stated.

Thanks you for your time!
